            The standard lorem ipsum passage has been a printer's friend for centuries. Like stock photos today, it served as a placeholder for actual content. The original text comes from Cicero's philosophical work "De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum," written in 45 BC.

            The use of the lorem ipsum passage dates back to the 1500s. When printing presses required painstaking hand-setting of type, workers needed something to show clients how their pages would look. To save time, they turned to Cicero's words, creating sample books filled with preset paragraphs.

            However, it wasn't until the 1960s that the passage became common when Letraset revolutionized the advertising industry with its transfer sheets. These innovative sheets allowed designers to apply pre-printed lorem ipsum text in various fonts and formats directly onto their mockups and prototypes.
